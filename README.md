# TestingApp
This repo is the set of projects created by https://github.com/eviltester to practice good testing techniques.
I have configured his repo to build and run in IntelliJ IDEA
## Setup
1. Ensure IntelliJ IDEA is downloaded properly and is able to use Maven
2. Select File -> New -> Project from Version Control...
3. Enter url https://github.com/kristacapps1/EvilTesterApps.git and login to git
4. The IntelliJ source roots and their module and lib dependencies will already be set up and should compile correctly
