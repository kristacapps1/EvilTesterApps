# Technical and Testing Challenges: Using the "Protect The Square" Game

![inline](protect-screenshot.png)

---

# Some games are not meant to be played, they are meant to be played with.

## This is that kind of game.

## What can you make it do?

---

# Where is it?

You can find the game here:

* https://www.compendiumdev.co.uk/games/buggygames/protect_the_square/protect_the_square.html

Or as part of the downloadable  "Evil Tester's Compendium of Testing Apps"

* https://github.com/eviltester/TestingApp

---

# Can you cheat? Exploit bugs? Re-enable hidden features? Extend the game?

## All suggestions in this document can be performed within the browser. No other tools necessary.

---

# Remember

## Anything that happens in your browser is yours to control,

### if you learn the skills to interrogate, observe, and manipulate the system you are working with.

---

# Non Technical Starting Activities

* Figure out how to play.
    - clue, use the mouse
* Any obvious bugs?
    - clue the known bugs do not require any technical knowledge

---

# Non Technical Planning Activities

* Build a list of improvements
    * Are there any feature requests that you would make for the developer? It is a useful exercise with any system to think through 'missing' requirements. And can you make a case for their inclusion i.e. 'why' should someone care

---

# Reconnoitre

* Read the source - anything in there that provides cause for concern or piques your interest?
* Using the source, what ideas do you have for manipulating the game. 

---

# Do the previous exercises before reading the following "Technical Challenges"

## otherwise they might influence you and you might not come up with as many ideas.

---

# If you want to manipulate the system technically, do that before reading the following technical challenges.

---

# Remember reading the technical challenges on the next page can spoil your enjoyment of the game.

---

# Did I say next page? I meant the page following this one. Be sure you want to read the challenges before turning this page.

---

# OK. Last Warning.

---

# Starter Technical Challenges & cheating

* Can you give yourself a high score?
* Can you give yourself infinite lives?
* Can you make the score display so that it shows the display in the HTML rather than on the canvas?

---

# Technical Challenges & cheating

* The developer has left some experimental levels in the game, can you enable them?
* The developer has some alternative score reporting mechanisms in the game, can you enable them?


---

# Technical Manipulation

* Can you create a 'bullet time' mechanism where you can fire a lot of shots without the enemy moving or reacting?
* Can you create your own levels?
    * Can you package your levels into a bookmarklet to make them easier to re-use or distribute?
* The developer left in a mechanism where the enemies can teleport, can you add that into the enemy "AI"?

---

# Automating

* Can you add some bot behaviour for your 'player' so that they move around the screen to avoid enemies?
* Can you make the player automatically shoot the enemies?
    * Can you do it strategically so that it shoots the nearest enemy?

---

# Push to the limits

* How much can you do, from the console to tweak the behaviour of the game and the game rules?
    * Can you add new behaviour rules for the enemies?
    * Can you change the spawning ground for the enemies to be the middle of the screen rather than the top?

---

# Make Something New - Can you add new features? 

* The developer did not implement keyboard control for the player - can you add that?
* Can you add a smart bomb that destroys all the enemies on screen?
* Can you add a proximity bomb that destroys enemies within a certain pixel radius?
* Can you add a teleport button to move the player randomly out of trouble?
* What other features could you add?
