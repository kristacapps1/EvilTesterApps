# Dear Evil Tester

A book by Alan Richardson.

While it appears to have been written primarily for testers, so that they know that someone out there cares. Someone out there is prepared to let the world know what a 'testing' attitude is really about.

The reality is that this book is for everyone. Really, everyone: politicians, plumbers, stay at home dads, working moms, that guy on the street that no-one really knows what he does.

And we're not exclusive, we'll even admit that it is for everyone involved in the Software Development process: project managers, product owners, analysts and developers. After all, how else are you going to understand how testers think? And how are you ever going to achieve a quality product unless you infuse yourself and everyone else with a testing attitude?

This book is for everyone that wants to know what a tester's attitude really feels like.

With hard hitting humour designed to hit beliefs where they change. Based on the author's lifetime study of psychotherapy and cult mind control techniques, this book knows how to trigger a reaction.

With advice on automating, communication, talking at conferences, psychotherapy for testers, exploratory testing, tools, technical testing, and more. Dear Evil Tester randomly samples the Software Testing stomping ground before walking all over it.

But you probably want some chapter and section headings, so here goes:

- When is testing not required?
- Why are you Evil?
- What is the most evil metric?
- Any tips for a certification exam?
- How can I get involved at the requirements stage?
- Can I make a decent living as a tester?
- How do you deal with a tester not pulling their weight?
- How to track exploratory testing?
- What is exploratory testing?
- Can anyone test?

And that's just a small sample...
