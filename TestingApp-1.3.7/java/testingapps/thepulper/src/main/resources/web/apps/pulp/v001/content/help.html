<h2 id="thepulper">The Pulper</h2>

<p>The Pulper is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.</p>

<p>The data sets are Pulp Magazine editions from the 30s and 40s because, frankly, who doesn't love reading pulp magazines.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>The data has a variety of publishers, magazines and series pre-populated.</p>

<p>Each user has a unique session. This is valid for 5 minutes without activity, at which point it will be deleted and you will be provided with a new session.</p>

<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>

<p>The main entities are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Publisher - who has published a magazine</li>

    <li>Author - person who wrote the story</li>

    <li>Series - the series or 'hero' e.g. The Spider</li>

    <li>Book - an actual edition of a magazine</li>
</ul>

<p>Book brings all of the entities together in that a Book has a publisher, an Author (multiple authors often), belongs in a Series and also has a House Author.</p>

<p>Note, not all pulp magazine fit into this model. Since this is a test app I don't really mind.</p>

<h2 id="screens">Screens</h2>

<p>We have a variety of screens showing clickable reports, lists of stuff, create screens, edit/amend screens and you can delete Entity Instances (e.g. a book) from the edit screens.</p>

<p>I'm sure you'll find your way around.</p>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>

<p>You can find different versions of the app downloadable from Github</p>

<ul>
    <li>https://github.com/eviltester/TestingApp/releases</li>
</ul>

<p>The different versions may be easier to automate, harder, different stylings, buggy etc.</p>

<h2 id="pulpmagazines">Pulp Magazines</h2>

<p>It can be outrageously expensive to collect original pulp magazines and they have a tendency to fall apart when you try to read them.</p>

<p>Fortunately Archive.org whave quite a lot of <a href="https://archive.org/details/pulpmagazinearchive">scanned pulps</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, the pulp archive above does not seem to have any issues of The Spider, or Doc Savage but there are companies still <a href="http://www.thepulp.net/the-hunt/reprints-replicas/">reprinting these today</a>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend hunting out reprints of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Spider</li>

    <li>The Avenger</li>

    <li>Doc Savage</li>

    <li>The Shadow</li>

    <li>Operator 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Or you could read easier to get hold of reprints e.g. HP Lovecraft, or Robert E Howard's Conan or Solomon Kane.</p>
